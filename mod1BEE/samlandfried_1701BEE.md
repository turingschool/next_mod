Congratulations on making an awesome decision to come to Turing. I finished up Mod 1 last week, and it was a hoot. I learned a ton, made some friends and ate some cheese curds. So, overall, 6 weeks well spent. During the weeks and months to come, you will be challenged in (probably) new ways. Depending on your technical background, the curriculum might be a cakewalk or daunting, but don't measure your own performance by the performance of others. There will (probably) always be someone quicker or slower than you in your cohort, and that doesn't mean you're behind or ahead. Release any notion of competition, is my point. Push yourself to progress as much as you can and your money/time will be well spent. The most valuable skill you'll learn is self-reliance. Teachers are great, but the sooner you learn to solve problems on your own, the sooner you'll start thinking like a professional, which means the sooner you'll be ready for a job. And despite that previous point, if you want some technical input or guidance on any projects, hit me up: @landfried. 

Also, be nice to everyone, always. There are a lot of people in this basement, and we're usually under a lot of stress, so do your part to keep the SS Turing sailing smoothly. 

Last, handle your shit. That means eat well, sleep enough and get some exercise. You might be able to power through a month or two of unsustainable habits, but much longer than that and you'll fall apart which won't be good for anybody. 

I hope that's helpful! Everyone's unique and has different needs, so I tried to keep the advice general. Just don't freak out. And if you do freak out, don't freak out about freaking out. This is hard and unusual but it will be over soon and you'll be a top notch developer with an extremely valuable skill set sooner than you can imagine. asdf
