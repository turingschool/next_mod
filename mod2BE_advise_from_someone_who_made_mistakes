#START THE PREWORK ON MONDAY! THERE IS MORE THAN YOU THINK
this is SOOOO much better than mod 1, the teachers care about you!
"google it" will be repeated anytime you ask a question on code, dont get mad at this.
### the structure is be confused during the assignment, then the next day you clarify in class. WRITE DOWN QUESTIONS AS YOU GO
#DO THE TUTORIALS (MIXMASTER, BLOGGER) MULTIPLE TIMES!
#THERE IS A LOT OF PREWORK
the error messages in rails are the best thing you will ever see READ THEM!
group projects x2 in this mod. DONT DO THEM REMOTELY especially if your not a git master
become a Gitmaster. 
A well structured question in a pull request will git (pun) you the best answer the fastest
# CRUD-TON OF PREWORK (seriously)
rake routes = love
setup a folder in bookmarks on chrome with all the docs/cheatsheets you will use them religously
